# Climate Language Processing

Author(s): Bryan Flores & Vivian Do
## Introduction
Climate change, also often referred to as the climate crisis, has garnered significant attention in recent decades due to its profound impact on the environment, ecosystems, and human societies worldwide. Scientific consensus overwhelmingly supports that climate change is primarily driven by human activities. 

Despite the overwhelming scientific consensus on the reality and severity of climate change, a significant portion of the population remains skeptical and even dismissive of the issue. Recent studies indicate that approximately one in seven Americans do not believe that a climate crisis exists (Dewan, 2024). This skepticism can be attributed, at least in part, to the diverse and often contradictory messaging surrounding climate change in the media. The framing of climate change narratives and the selection of topics for coverage both contribute to shaping public perceptions and attitudes. 

Adaptation of language used for climate change communication so that it's more receptive to different audiences. The goal is *not* to manipulate, but to create a path towards an object goal between different peoples.
